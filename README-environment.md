## ⚙️ Requirement
Using Python `venv` to build a virtual environment. 

First, ensure you're using `Python>=3.9`. If you don't have one, `sudo apt install python3.9` should install a Python 3.9 under `/usr/bin/python3.9`.

With `/usr/bin/python3.9`, first create a venv environment by:
```bash
python3.9 -m venv vista3d_venv
```
Then activate the environment:
```bash
source vista3d_venv/bin/activate
```
The environment should be correctly installed by:
```bash
bash environment.sh
```
